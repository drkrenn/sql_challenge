Module 9 Challenge

**File Location**
All files for the assignment can be found inside the EmployeeSQL folder. 

For the data modeling piece, the modeling syntax is saved inside a txt file titled "modeling_syntax.txt." 
The model itself is saved as a PNG image under the name "Data Modeling.PNG."

For the data engineering piece, the 6 csv files are contained in this folder. 
The syntax used to convert them into SQL tables is found in the file "Data Engineering.sql."

All of the query/data analysis components are found in a single syntax file. It is "Data Analysis.sql."


**Syntax Sources**
Although I did reach out to teaching assistants, I was able to figure out my few questions on my own. 
Therefore, all of the code, including the print code and calculational code was self-generated or was copied/altered from class material with no outside sources copied. 
I did look at a few websites to make sure I was coding the year filter correctly. However, no code was copied from those websites.
